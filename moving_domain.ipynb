    "\n",
    "In the stationary case, the elements of a mesh are classified according to the values that the levelset function takes on them. Elements with only negative levelset values are called `NEG`, while those with only positive values will be `POS`.\n",
    "The cut elements are those on which the levelset function takes negative and positive values. These are called `IF`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the instationary case, the elements change their type as the domain moves through the mesh. We need to find a suitable generalization of the classification described above for elements belonging to a specific time slab. When the time slab is bounded by the time points `told` and `tnew = told + delta_t`, then we will calculate the integrals at certain points `told + t_i * delta_t` with `t_i` belonging to the reference interval $[0,1]$. At these points, the `CutInfo` provides information about the element types. Combining the information at all these points yields the desired generalization of an element type with respect to a time slab. For example, an element is classified as `hasneg_spacetime` when it has been `NEG` or `IF` on at least one of the points `told + t_i * delta_t`. When determining the interface elements `hasif_spacetime` one needs to be a bit careful. These elements include the ones that have been `IF` on at least one of the points `told + t_i * delta_t`. However, for large time steps `delta_t` it may also happen that an element jumps from `POS` to `NEG` or the other way around without ever having been in `IF` at the considered points in time. These elements need also to be included in `hasif_spacetime`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The element markers are needed for various tasks. For example, the linear system on the time slab is solved with respect to the degrees of freedom that belong to the `hasneg_spacetime` elements. Also, we need them to determine the facets on which ghost-penalty stabilization will be carried out. The relevant facets are the ones that lie between the elements that are classified as `hasneg_spacetime` and `hasif_spacetime` and are obtained by: \n",

    "Now the actual problem can be solved. Firstly, we update the slab discretization with the time step and define a couple of things. For example, a dummy matrix which will later later become the system matrix for solution on the time slab. Also we define the cutinfo, which provides information how elements are cut. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then the time loop is carried out. In any stage of this loop we have to solve a problem on the time slab bounded by the time levels `told` and `tnew`. To this end, the information at times `told + t_i * delta_t` where `t_i` are discrete time points on the reference interval has to be collected. At these points we have to query the corresponding integrators provided by the slab discretization and  assemble the matrices/vectors. These are then added to the dummy matrix/vector mentioned in the beginning that describes the linear system on the whole time slab. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before the system can be assembled we have to inform the bilinear and linear forms on which type of elements, e.g. \"hasneg_at_ti\", they are defined. This is done by the command `form.SetDefinedOnElements(markers[key])`, which has the effect that the integrator is applied on the elements/facets specified in `markers[key]`.\n",

    "The required BitArrays for this are provided by cutinfo: \n",

    "In the end, the linear system has to be solved. This is done with respect to the degrees of freedom which have been part of the active mesh in at least one of the time points  `told + t_i * delta_t`. For this approach to work, additional stabilization is required. We employ Ghost-Penalty stabilization for this purpose.\n",
